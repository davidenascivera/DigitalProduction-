# DigitalProduction-
This repository collects all the assignments and projects from the course *Digital Production and Logistics Systems*. The coursework focuses on solving complex optimization problems, both linear and quadratic, alongside practical simulations. A significant part of the project was implemented using AutoMod.

## Assignments Overview:
1. **Assignment 1: Class-Based Storage Assignment Problem**  
   Optimization problem focusing on minimizing picking distances in a warehouse through class-based storage allocation.

2. **Assignment 2: Bi-Objective Periodic Review**  
   Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) problem with a focus on minimizing both economic and environmental impacts of inventory management.

3. **Assignment 3: Order Batching Problem**  
   Solving an order picking problem using different seed rules and comparing their effects on warehouse order batching.

4. **Assignment 4: GlobalEat Food Delivery Optimization**  
   Vehicle routing problem for optimizing delivery schedules and minimizing travel times for a food delivery company using Python and CPLEX.

## Final Project: Car Door Production Process Simulation (AutoMod)
A simulated representation of a car door manufacturer's production system, which involved optimizing the production flow for left and right car doors. The system includes polishing, painting, stamping, and quality-checking processes, with additional analysis on minimizing truck delays and maximizing resource utilization. Various production layouts were tested to identify the most efficient configuration, balancing workstations to reduce bottlenecks and idle times.
